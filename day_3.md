## binning
### which contigs belong to which genome


sequence completion
=k-mer frequencies are similiar within one genome\
Ausnahme: rRNA (highly conserved) + genomic islands (foreign DNA) will probably stand out

multiple sample coverage
=coverage of contigs changes similiary in different samples when they belong to the same genome


---

## quality parameters to check afterwards

- contamination (multiple copies of single copy genes)
- completion of the genome (presence or absence of single copy genes)
- fragmentation (how many contigs form one genome, more contigs=more fragmented)
- heterogenicity
